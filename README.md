The goal of the project is to create artistic images of your pictures and make this available at your fingertip on your phone !. The project uses image abstraction techniques which are discussed :

- [Image Abstraction by Structure Adaptive Filtering](https://www.kyprianidis.com/p/tpcg2008/)  by by Jan Eric Kyprianidis and Jürgen Döllner
- [Image and Video Abstraction by Coherence-Enhancing Filtering](https://www.kyprianidis.com/p/eg2011/jkyprian-eg2011.pdf) by Jan Eric Kyprianidis and  Henry Kang
- [Real-time video abstraction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220184181_Real-time_video_abstraction/link/568c559508ae71d5cd04d615/download) by Holger Winnemoeller

The application is a Web app powered by react. Since web application can allow the user to select images, and access them, the technology is well suited  for this purpose.
